Retrievers are responsible for selecting the most relevant information from a knowledge base. Popular types of retrievers include:

- BM25: A classic term-based scoring algorithm.
- Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR): Learns dense embeddings using contrastive learning.
- ColBERT: Uses late interaction over contextualized embeddings for fine-grained retrieval.

Retrievers encode queries and documents into the same vector space and retrieve via similarity search.
