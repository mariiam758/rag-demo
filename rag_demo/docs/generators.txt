Popular generators in RAG setups include:

- GPT-3: An autoregressive transformer model by OpenAI.
- BART: A sequence-to-sequence model trained with denoising objectives.
- T5: Treats NLP problems as text-to-text tasks.
- Mistral: An efficient, open-source model suitable for local RAG systems.

These generators use retrieved context to produce grounded and fluent natural language responses.
