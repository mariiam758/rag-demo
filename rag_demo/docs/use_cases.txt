RAG systems are useful in many real-world applications:

- Open-domain Question Answering
- Enterprise Knowledge Base Chatbots
- Legal and Medical Document Assistants
- Research Summarization Tools
- Customer Support Automation

RAG is especially effective when the model must stay up-to-date or grounded in specific content.
