Embedding models transform text into numerical vector representations. Common models include:

- all-MiniLM-L6-v2: Small and fast model for sentence embeddings.
- text-embedding-ada-002: OpenAIâ€™s powerful and cost-effective embedding model.
- nomic-embed-text-v1.5: A high-quality open-source embedding model for semantic search.

These embeddings are indexed with tools like FAISS to enable fast similarity search.
